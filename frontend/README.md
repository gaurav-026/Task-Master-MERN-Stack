### `Features of The Website`

-> User can Add, Edit, Delete and Mark on the completed Task. The completed tasks will be visible on clicking the Today's Analaysis Button present on the right of the website.
-> The website is purely responsive for the Mobile, Tablet and Desktop view.
-> This Website took 4 days(1 day UI Design, 1 Day Static part Developement, 2 Days for Functionalities) for proper completion.
-> This website is designed and developed by my own. Each and every step is my thought process + some internet help for logic buildings.
-> I have tried to give as best I can in these days. I will convert this project as a full stack project soon.


### `Libraries and Frameworks Used`

-> React.js
-> ContextAPI
-> Bootstrap
-> Figma Design (UI of the website)
-> JS, CSS
-> uuid : for generating id
-> ChatGPT


### `Considerations`

-> I have firstly used Context Api for myself. It was a bit challenging for me to implement the functionalities using ContextAPI. First I have build my fundamentals on ContextAPI again and then start implementation on the project functionalities. I am also a UI/UX designer, so thinking about good UI was not very challenging for me. This project is going to be one of the favourite project for me. I will definately improve this and will add Full Stack Features in it.
